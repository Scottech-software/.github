# Scottech Software
We build practical software and automations that are fast to ship, easy to maintain, and safe to operate.

## What we do
- Product engineering (web apps, internal tools, integrations)
- Automation & agentic workflows (bots, digests, PR helpers, monitoring)
- Data + APIs (clean interfaces, reliable pipelines)
- DevOps foundations (deployment, observability, hardening)

## Stack we like
- Ruby / Rails
- Node.js / TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Linux
- Containers when it helps (Docker/Compose)

## How we work
- Ship small, iterate quickly
- Prefer boring, proven tech
- Measure reliability (timeouts, retries, observability)
- Secure by default (least privilege, secrets hygiene, minimal exposure)

## Collaboration
If you have a project idea, a repo you want improved, or an automation you’d like built, open an issue with:
- What you want
- Who it’s for
- Constraints (timeline, budget, hosting)
- Links/screenshots/logs (if relevant)

## Security
If you find a security issue, please report it privately:
